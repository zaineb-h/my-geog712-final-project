(2017)
OH-Pyr,Wildland firefighters (n = 12),LC-FLD (solid-phase extraction of 10 mL of urine),"No significant difference reported in urinary mutagenicity between firefighters on burn days vs nonburn days, but a significant correlation was observed between urinary mutagenicity and urinary OH-Pyr.",Adetona et al. (2019)
"OH-Pyr, OH-Nap, OH-Flu, OH-Phe",Structural firefighters (n = 15),ELISA,Median concentrations for all OH-PAHs increased in urine from before to after 3Â h of training exercises. A 30-fold increase in OH-Pyr was reported with the highest levels in oriented strand board fire exercises.,Fent et al. (2019)
"OH-Pyr, OH-Phe, OH-Flu, OH-Nap",Structural firefighters (n = 34),LC-MS/MS (on-line solid-phase extraction with 0.1 mL of urine),Median concentrations for all OH-PAHs increased in urine from before to after 3Â h of training exercises. A 30-fold increase in OH-Pyr was observed with the highest levels observed in oriented strand board fire exercises.,Fent et al. (2014)
"OH-Pyr, 2-OH-Nap, 1-OH-Phe, 3-OH-Phe, 2-OH-Flu 9-OH-Flu",Wildland firefighters (n = 42),LC-MS/MS (dilution and direct injection); GC-HRMS (solid-phase extraction and derivatization),"Good mutual agreement between LC-MS/MS and GC-HRMS for OH-Pyr that was dependent on enzyme hydrolysis reaction times. 3-OH-Phe and 9-OH-Flu were positively correlated with OH-Pyr, with urinary OH-Pyr levels below the recommended biological exposure index.",Gill et al. (2019)
OH-Pyr,Wildland firefighters (n = 42),LC-MS/MS (dilution and direct injection),"OH-Pyr was detected in 71% of firefighter urine samples after deployment. Among the samples collected within 48Â h, OH-Pyr was correlated with estimated exposure. Lower urinary OH-Pyr was reported in firefighters with a high skin exposure mitigation index.",Cherry et al. (2019)
"OH-Pyr, OH-Nap",Structural firefighters (n = 16),LC-FLD (solid-phase extraction); GC-ECD (derivatization),"Highest excretion of OH-Pyr was reported when burning conifer plywood and chipboard, while the lowest was pine and sprucewood, indicating burning material impacts smoke exposure.",Laitinen et al. (2010)
"OH-Pyr, OH-Nap",Structural firefighters (n = 13),LC-FLD (solid-phase extraction); GC-ECD (derivatization),Dermal exposure of PAHs delays excretion of OH-Pyr and OH-Nap. Biological action limit values for 1-OH-Pyr were reported as 53Â nM.,Laitinen et al. (2012)

(2016)
OH-Pyr,Structural firefighters (n = 22),LC-FLD (solid-phase extraction),"Skin deposition of pyrene and urinary OH-Pyr did not differ before and after work shifts, irrespective of fire extinguishing role. Increased work shift was not associated with genotoxicity based on oxidative damage to DNA.",Andersen et al. (2018)
"OH-Pyr, OH-Nap, OH-Flu, OH-Phe,",Structural firefighters (n = 27 firefighters; 18 office workers),GC-MS/MS (liquid-liquid extraction and derivatization),"A significant 2.9- to 5.3-fold increase in average postevent urinary PAH metabolites was observed, with 54% of the variation in fold changes being due to air vs. skin exposure. Postevent urinary mutagenicity showed a significant increase by 4.3-fold for postshift urine samples.",Keir et al. (2017)
"OH-Pyr,",Wildland firefighters (n = 22),LC-FLD,"Particulate matter measurements indicated the use of personal protective equipment effectively prevented inhalation exposure, but exposure still occurred owing to early removal of equipment. Skin deposition of pyrene was correlated to urinary OH-Pyr for most firefighters.",Wingfors et al. (2017)
